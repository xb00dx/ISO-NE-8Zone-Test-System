# ISO-NE-8Zone-Test-System
Based on the [original system](https://bitbucket.org/kdheepak/eightbustestbedrepo/) created by [Dheepak Krishnamurthy](https://github.com/kdheepak)

## Original System
The 8-Zone Test System is a framework based on ISO New England data that has been implemented using the AMES Wholesale Power Market Test Bed. AMES is a computational platform (Java/Python) permitting the small-scale study of U.S. centrally-managed wholesale power markets operating over AC transmission grids with congestion handled by locational marginal pricing.
