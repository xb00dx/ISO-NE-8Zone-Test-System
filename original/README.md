# Introduction #

The 8-Zone Test System is a framework based on ISO New England data that has been implemented using the AMES Wholesale Power Market Test Bed.  AMES is a computational platform (Java/Python) permitting the small-scale study of U.S. centrally-managed wholesale power markets operating over AC transmission grids with congestion handled by locational marginal pricing.

# Basic information about the 8-Zone Test System: #

The 8-Zone Test System consists of three basic parts:

(1)  Test System Data: Test System Data is based on data from ISO New England and other reliable sources.

(2)  Test System Construction Scripts: These scripts build test cases for the 8-Zone Test System that can be run by means of AMES.

(3)  Test System Output Parsing Scripts: These scripts parse the results of these test case runs to calculate costs and other desired outputs.
